# Note
As of right now this is not finished. I am releasing it in this state because I am worried I may not ever finish it, and I don't want what I have done to go to waste. If you have suggestions/errors/questions:

* Let me know what phone you are using and what OS
* Screenshots are more helpful than I can express
* You can reach me here: (515) 357-3471, but text me, dont call.
* My email is nanobytesinc@gmail.com
* My Reddit username is NanoBytesInc

# Play Store
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nanobytes.pickaxe (that is not working right now)

# APK

https://github.com/NanoBytesInc/Pickaxe/raw/master/v1.0.apk

# What is this project?

This started out with me noticing that I had a few extra devices laying around, and a curiosity to see if I could put them to work. This was first realized with my project here: [miners](https://github.com/NanoBytesInc/miners), but that was cumbersome and a little scary for the uninitiated. So now we are here, with an app that wraps up all of the functionality of the last project with some extra features that actually put it notably ahead of the other mobile miners on the market.

But then the play store banned crypto mining apps, and development of the project slowed significantly. This current version is re-written from the ground up, and is always running the latest version of Xmrig!

# Features

* The fastest mining on the market (by roughly %20 on high end phones when compared to MinerGate or AAMiner)
* Allows you to mine to which ever pool you want to (again, being compared to MinerGate)
* Can mine any CryptoNight coin, but has built in support for Monero, Aeon, TurtleCoin, and more.
* Saves your configurations so they do not need to constantly be re-entered
* Allows you to schedule when to mine (eg, from 11pm - 8am everyday).
* VERY Stable (my 5 Android devices have been running for over a week, 24/7 without a problem)
* Works with the screen off
* Clean interface (this cannot be underestimated)
* Has a notification to show your stats across apps
* Shows your current balance for the supported pools you can mine to (Supports +10 pools across the 5 coins)

# What it runs on

As of right now I have tested this app on Android Lollipop, Nougat, and Oreo; Aarch 64 processors. Notably: The Pixel 2XL, the Note 8, and the Moto G6

# Is it open source?

No... I was intending to release the source code for this app, but the scary number of people who have asked me for help inserting miners into their own arbitrary apps (fitness trackers, crypto trackers, etc) has made me realize that releasing this code would be tantamount to releasing malware into the Android Ecosystem. I do not want that.

But the xmrig binary that this app uses is fully open source and can be found here: [miners](https://github.com/NanoBytesInc/miners)

# If you want you pool added into the app
Send me an email here: nanobytesinc@gmail.com, and if you pool has solved a few blocks, and has a low enough difficulty we can work together!

# If you have any issues / comments
Feel 100% free to contact me! I want this to work for everyone, and as a student, I have a lot of time to tinker with things :D

# Upcoming work

Here are some of the things that I am going to be adding in the near future

* See your balance for all of the listed pools
* Only mine on WiFi
* Only mine while charging
* Add wallet address from QR code
* Add more pools for the listed coins
* Add more Cryptonight based coins
